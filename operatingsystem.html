<h2>Operating Systems Terminology</h2>
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Term</th>
        <th>Definition</th>
    </tr>
        <td>operating system </td>
        <td>The software that controls the overall operation of the computer including file management, the user interface, and the program execution environment. </td>
    </tr>
        <td>job queue </td>
        <td> In batch processing systems, the jobs residing in mass storage wait for execution here. The execution of each program is a job and a queue is a storage organization in which objections are ordered. </td>
    </tr>
        <td>FIFO </td>
        <td>This is part of the queue structure in FI-foe fashion, first-in, first-out job priority order. </td>
    </tr>
        <td>interactive processing </td>
        <td>New operating systems allow program execution with a user through remote terminals. </td>
    </tr>
        <td>time-sharing </td>
        <td> A feature that provides service to multiple users at the same time. </td>
    </tr>
        <td>multiprogramming </td>
        <td> A means to implement time-sharing in which time is divided into intervals and then the execution of each job is restricted to only one interval at a time. </td>
    </tr>
        <td>application software </td>
        <td>Application software consists of the programs for performing tasks particular to the machine's utilization</td>
    </tr>
        <td>utility software </td>
        <td>Utility software consists of software units that extend/customize the capabilitys of the operating system. </td>
    </tr>
        <td>graphical user interface (GUI) </td>
        <td> More modern systems which communicate with users in which objects to be manipulated, such as files and programs, are represented pictorially on the display as icons. </td>
    </tr>
        <td>shell </td>
        <td>Older user interfaces communicate with users through textual messages using a keyboard and monitor screen.</td>
    </tr>
        <td>kernel </td>
        <td>The internal part of an operating system which contains software components that perform the very basic functions required by the computer installation. </td>
    </tr>
        <td>device driver </td>
        <td>Another component of the kernel which are the software units that communicate with the controllers (or at times, directly with peripheral devices) to carry out operations on the peripheral devices attached to the machine. </td>
    </tr>
        <td>file manager </td>
        <td>The file managers coordinates the use of the machine's mass storage facilities. It maintains records of all the files stored in mass storage including where each file is located, which users are allowed to access the various files, and which portions of mass storage are available for new files or extensions to existing files. </td>
    </tr>
        <td>manager </td>
        <td>Another component of the operating system's kernel which coordinates the machine's use of main memory. </td>
    </tr>    
        <td>virtual memory </td>
        <td>Large "fictional" memory space created by paging. </td>
    </tr>
        <td>boot strapping </td>
        <td>Or "booting," this occurs when the operating system gets started. The computer turning on is accomplished through boot strapping. This procedure transfers the operating system from mass storage (where it is permanently stored) into main memory (which is essentially empty when the machine is first turned on). </td>
    </tr>
        <td>ROM </td>
        <td>Read-only memory can be read but not altered. A small portion of a computer's main memory where the CPU expects to find its initial program is constructed from special nonvolatile memorhy cells. </td>
    </tr>
        <td>deadlock </td>
        <td>The condition in which two or more processes are blocked from progressing because each is waiting for a resource that is allocated to another. </td>
    </tr>
        <td>spooling </td>
        <td> A technique of holding data for output at a later but more convenient time. </td>
    </tr>
        <td>super user (or administrator) </td>
        <td>Accounts are established by this person. </td>
    </tr>
        <td>multi-factor authentication </td>
        <td>A security measure that requires a user to provide multiple pieces of evidence to gain access to the user's account. </td>
